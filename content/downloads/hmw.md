### Prerequisites
- Modern Warfare Remastered from Steam or [Torrent](https://github.com/CBServers/client-dowloads/raw/main/torrents/h1_full_files.torrent)
- [h2m-mod-cb.exe](https://github.com/CBServers/updater/raw/main/updater/h2m/h2m-mod-cb.exe) file

### Guide
1. Download [h2m-mod-cb.exe](https://github.com/CBServers/updater/raw/main/updater/h2m/h2m-mod-cb.exe).
2. Place it in your installed MWR game folder (Steam MWR or torrented MWR).
3. Open the client by double clicking on the exe.
4. Allow game to update when prompted.
6. Done! Game should launch after update. You will only need to use `h2m-mod-cb.exe` from now on. You can safely delete `h2m-mod.exe` if you have it.

**For detailed tutorial on how to download MWR through torrent, see our [game torrent install guide](/guides/torrents).**
