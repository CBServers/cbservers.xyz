2. Click on desired game in the sidebar.
3. Click the SETUP  button and the install type:
    * Existing install - select the folder where your existing game files are located.
    * Download game - select folder where you want to download game and choose game content (Campaign, DLC, etc).
4. Wait for game to download or if you setup an existing install, it is recommended you verify files by clicking the VERIFY button.
5. Click PLAY to start the client! (Some games require game mode selection before starting)
#### MANAGE INSTALLS
The launcher can be used to install/remove certain additional content of any game (Campaign, DLC, etc). This applies to games you already have installed (Steam or Torrents) or games you installed from the launcher. Once a game is fully installed (either method), you can click on "Manage Install" button on the game page and select content you want to install/remove. Deselected components will be removed.
#### SUPPORT PAGE
The launcher features a support page at the bottom of the sidebar for quick links to our Discord Server and script to install redistributables. Various games require Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables and DirectX to run properly. This is REQUIRED before playing on of the clients or you may experience crashes. 
#### GAME AND LAUNCHER SETTINGS
Each game has a settings popup you can access by clicking the Cog Wheel on the game page to see the game's install path, game launch behavior, game options, and launch args. The launcher also has a settings page to configure various launcher specific settings alongside the Download Server selector. Default server selection is Auto, which chooses the fastest one. However, this can be changed manually from the dropdown menu (NA or EU).
