2. **Download game files using Torrent client**
    
    After downloading the game Torrent, you'll need to download the game files.
    1. Download and install a Torrent client such as [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download).
    2. Open your Torrent client, then go to `File -> Add Torrent File...` and select the torrent file you downloaded.
    3. Choose a location where you'd like to save the game files and start the download.
    4. This will take a while but you will know it is done when the satus of your download shows: `Seeding` or `Completed`.

3. **Download game client**

    Now, you'll need to download the actual client for the game you downloaded.

    You can find the downloads for all the game clients we support [here](/downloads).
