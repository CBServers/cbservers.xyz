### Prerequisites
- Be in a Trickshot Server for the desired game.
- Be in the [Celebrity & Brad Trickshotting](/discord) Discord Server with the VIP role.
- Have a brain.

### Written Guide
1. **Join any of our trickshotting servers on any game.**

    Join the server for the game you want your VIP fixed on. For example, if you want your VIP fixed on H2M-Mod, join one of our H2M-Mod servers.

2. **Use the `!who` command in game chat**
    - Type `!who` **in game chat (NOT IN DISCORD)** and hit enter.
    - You should get a message from the server that includes your **Client ID.** It's the 5 digit number following the @ symbol.
